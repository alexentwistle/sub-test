# SubTest
Identify a website's accessible and indexable subdomains

1. Take user input for the domain to be tested
2. Enumerate subdomains (using sublist3r) and export
3. Construct URLs from subdomains (include both HTTP and HTTPS versions if necessary)
4. Retrieve status codes for exported subdomains, using Requests library
5. Identify accessible subdomains, and check for indexability (look for 'noindex' tag in code)
